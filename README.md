A Julia module for

- finding attractors of arbitrary dynamical systems
- finding their basins of attraction or the state space fractions of the basins
- analyzing global stability of attractors (also called non-local stability or  resilience)
- "continuing" the attractors and their basins over a parameter range
- finding the basin boundaries and analyzing their fractal properties
- tipping points related functionality for systems with known dynamic rule
- and more!

It can be used as a standalone package, or as part of
[DynamicalSystems.jl](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DynamicalSystemsDocs.jl/dynamicalsystems/stable/).

To install it, run `import Pkg; Pkg.add("Attractors")`.

All further information is provided in the documentation, which you can either find [online](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DynamicalSystemsDocs.jl/attractors/stable/) or build locally by running the `docs/make.jl` file.

_Previously, Attractors.jl was part of ChaosTools.jl_
