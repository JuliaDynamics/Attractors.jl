# v1.11
- New algorithm `subdivision_based_grid`. Allows user to automatically constuct the grid which simulates subdivision into regions with different discretization levels in accordance with state space flow speed.

# v1.10
- Added support of irregular grids to `AttractorsViaRecurrences`, now user can provide ranges without fixed step along the same axis.

# v1.9
- Matching attractors during the continuation with `RAFM` has been improved and is done by the function `match_continuation!` which has two options regarding how to handle attractors of previous parameters that have vanished.

# v1.8
- New algorithm `minimal_fatal_shock` that finds the minimal perturbation for arbitrary initial condition `u0` which will kick the system into different from the current basin.

# v1.7.1
- Fixed issue where poincare map was not working with basins of attraction as intended (sampling points directly on the hyperplane)

# v1.7

- Some functions have been renamed for higher level of clarity (deprecations have been put in place):
  - `match_attractor_ids!` -> `match_statespacesets!`
  - `GroupAcrossParameter` -> `FeaturizeGroupAcrossParameter`.

# v1.6
- Attractors.jl moved to Julia 1.9+
- Plotting utility functions are now part of the API using package extensions. They are exported, documented, and used in the examples.

# v1.5
- Our pre-print regarding the global stability analysis framework offered by Attractors.jl is now online: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12786
- Package now has a CITATION.bib file.

# v1.4
- New function `rematch!` that can be used after `continuation` is called with `AttractorsViaRecurrences`, if the original matching performed was not ideal.

# v1.3
- More plotting functions have been added and plotting has been exposed as API. After Julia 1.9 it will also be documented and formally included in the built docs.

# v1.2
- Add option `force_non_adaptive` to `AttractorsViaRecurrences`. This option is of instrumental importance when the grid is too fine or when limit cycle attractors are involved.

# v1.1

- `basins_fractions` no longer returns the attractors. Instead, a function `extract_attractors(mapper::AttractorMapper)` is provided that gives the attractors. This makes an overall more convenient experience that doesn't depend on the type of the initial conditions used.

# v1
- Added the `continuation` function and the two types `RecurrencesFindAndMatch` and `GroupAcrossParameterContinuation`

# v0.1.0
This is the first release. It continues from ChaosTools.jl v2.9, and hence, the comparison of attractor-related features is w.r.t to that version.

## Finding attractors
- New attractor mapping algorithm `AttractorsViaRecurrencesSparse` that uses sparse arrays to find attractors of arbitrarily high dimensional dynamical systems, eliminating the main drawback of `AttractorsViaRecurrences`.
- Clustering (used in `AttractorsViaFeaturizing`) has been completely overhauled. Now, a `ClusteringConfig` instances must be created and then passed on to `AttractorsViaFeaturizing`.
- `AttractorsViaFeaturizing` no longer has keywords about clustering.
- A new function `cluster_features` is exported to the public API.
- Multithreading is now an option in `AttractorsViaFeaturizing`. It is enabled by default.
- Added a new clause in automatic `Îµ` estimation in `AttractorsViaProximity` for when there is only a single attractor passed in by the user.

## Basin fractions continuation
- New function `continuation` that calculates basins fractions and how these change versus a parameter (given a continuation method)
- New basins fraction continuation method `RecurrencesFindAndMatch` that utilizes a brand new algorithm to continuate basins fractions of arbitrary systems.
- `match_attractor_ids!` has been fully overhauled to be more flexible, allow more ways to match, and also allow arbitrary user-defined ways to match.
- New function `match_basins_ids!` for matching the output of basins_of_attraction`.
- New exported functions `swap_dict_keys!, unique_keys, replacement_map` used in code that matches attractors and could be useful to front-end users.
