## Latest news

- Our paper on the global stability analysis framework offered by Attractors.jl ([`continuation`](@ref)) and the novel continuation offered by [`RecurrencesFindAndMatch`](@ref) is published as a _Featured Article_ in Chaos (https://pubs.aip.org/aip/cha/article/33/7/073151/2904709/Framework-for-global-stability-analysis-of) and has been featured in the AIP publishing showcase (https://www.growkudos.com/publications/10.1063%25252F5.0159675/reader)
- New function [`minimal_fatal_shock`](@ref)
- New function [`match_continuation!`](@ref) which improves the matching during a continuation process where attractors dissapear and re-appear.

## Outline of Attractors.jl

1. First be sure that you are aware of what is a [`DynamicalSystem`](@ref). This is the input to the whole infrastructure of Attractors.jl.
2. The bulk of the work in Attractors.jl is done by the [`AttractorMapper`](@ref) type, that instructs how to find attractors and maps initial conditions to them. It can be used in functions like [`basins_fractions`](@ref).
3. For grouping features, there is a sub-infrastructure for instructing how to group features, which is governed by [`GroupingConfig`](@ref).
4. The infrastructure of finding attractors and their basins fractions is then integrated into a brand new way of doing bifurcation analysis in the [`continuation`](@ref) function.
5. See [Examples for Attractors.jl](@ref) for several applications in real world cases.
