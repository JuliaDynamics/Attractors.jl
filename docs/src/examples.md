# Examples for Attractors.jl

Note that the examples utilize some convenience plotting functions offered by Attractors.jl. In Julia 1.9+ these come into scope when using `Makie` (or any of its backends such as `CairoMakie`). In older versions of Julia, you need to find them and run them manually in the `src/plotting.jl` file.

## Newton's fractal (basins of 2D map)
```@example MAIN
using Attractors
function newton_map(z, p, n)
    z1 = z[1] + im*z[2]
    dz1 = newton_f(z1, p[1])/newton_df(z1, p[1])
    z1 = z1 - dz1
    return SVector(real(z1), imag(z1))
end
newton_f(x, p) = x^p - 1
newton_df(x, p)= p*x^(p-1)

ds = DiscreteDynamicalSystem(newton_map, [0.1, 0.2], [3.0])
xg = yg = range(-1.5, 1.5; length = 400)
# Use non-sparse for using `basins_of_attraction`
mapper = AttractorsViaRecurrences(ds, (xg, yg);
    sparse = false, mx_chk_lost = 1000
)
basins, attractors = basins_of_attraction(mapper; show_progress = false)
basins
```
```@example MAIN
attractors
```

Now let's plot this as a heatmap, and on top of the heatmap, let's scatter plot the attractors. We do this in one step by utilizing one of the pre-defined plotting functions offered by Attractors.jl

```@example MAIN
grid = (xg, yg)
heatmap_basins_attractors(grid, basins, attractors)
```

Instead of computing the full basins, we could get only the fractions of the basins of attractions using [`basins_fractions`](@ref), which is typically the more useful thing to do in a high dimensional system.
In such cases it is also typically more useful to define a sampler that generates initial conditions on the fly instead of pre-defining some initial conditions (as is done in [`basins_of_attraction`](@ref). This is simple to do:

```@example MAIN
grid = (xg, yg)
mapper = AttractorsViaRecurrences(ds, grid;
    sparse = false, mx_chk_lost = 1000
)

sampler, = statespace_sampler(;
    min_bounds = minimum.(grid), max_bounds = maximum.(grid)
)

basins = basins_fractions(mapper, sampler)
```

in this case, to also get the attractors we simply extract them from the underlying storage of the mapper:
```@example MAIN
attractors = extract_attractors(mapper)
```

## Fractality of 2D basins of the (4D) magnetic pendulum
In this section we will calculate the basins of attraction of the four-dimensional magnetic pendulum. We know that the attractors of this system are all individual fixed points on the (x, y) plane so we will only compute the basins there. We can also use this opportunity to highlight a different method, the [`AttractorsViaProximity`](@ref) which works when we already know where the attractors are. Furthermore we will also use a `ProjectedDynamicalSystem` to project the 4D system onto a 2D plane, saving a lot of computational time!

### Computing the basins

First we need to load in the magnetic pendulum from the predefined dynamical systems library
```@example MAIN
using PredefinedDynamicalSystems
ds = PredefinedDynamicalSystems.magnetic_pendulum(d=0.2, α=0.2, ω=0.8, N=3)
```

Then, we create a projected system on the x-y plane
```@example MAIN
psys = ProjectedDynamicalSystem(ds, [1, 2], [0.0, 0.0])
```

For this systems we know the attractors are close to the magnet positions. The positions can be obtained from the equations of the system, provided that one has seen the source code (not displayed here), like so:
```@example MAIN
attractors = Dict(i => StateSpaceSet([dynamic_rule(ds).magnets[i]]) for i in 1:3)
```

and then create a
```@example MAIN
mapper = AttractorsViaProximity(psys, attractors)
```

and as before, get the basins of attraction
```@example MAIN
xg = yg = range(-4, 4; length = 201)
grid = (xg, yg)
basins, = basins_of_attraction(mapper, grid; show_progress = false)

heatmap_basins_attractors(grid, basins, attractors)
```

### Computing the uncertainty exponent
Let's now calculate the [`uncertainty_exponent`](@ref) for this system as well.
The calculation is straightforward:
```@example MAIN
ε, f_ε, α = uncertainty_exponent(basins)
fig, ax = lines(log.(ε), log.(f_ε))
ax.title = "α = $(round(α; digits=3))"
fig
```
The actual uncertainty exponent is the slope of the curve (α) and indeed we get an exponent near 0 as we know a-priory the basins have fractal boundaries for the magnetic pendulum.

### Computing the tipping probabilities
We will compute the tipping probabilities using the magnetic pendulum's example
as the "before" state. For the "after" state we will change the `γ` parameter of the
third magnet to be so small, its basin of attraction will virtually disappear.
As we don't know _when_ the basin of the third magnet will disappear, we switch the attractor finding algorithm back to [`AttractorsViaRecurrences`](@ref).

```@example MAIN
set_parameter!(psys, :γs, [1.0, 1.0, 0.1])
mapper = AttractorsViaRecurrences(psys, (xg, yg); Δt = 1)
basins_after, attractors_after = basins_of_attraction(
    mapper, (xg, yg); show_progress = false
)
# matching attractors is important!
rmap = match_attractor_ids!(attractors_after, attractors)
# Don't forget to update the labels of the basins as well!
replace!(basins_after, rmap...)

# now plot
heatmap_basins_attractors(grid, basins_after, attractors_after)
```

And let's compute the tipping "probabilities":

```@example MAIN
P = tipping_probabilities(basins, basins_after)
```
As you can see `P` has size 3×2, as after the change only 2 attractors have been identified
in the system (3 still exist but our state space discretization isn't fine enough to
find the 3rd because it has such a small basin).
Also, the first row of `P` is 50% probability to each other magnet, as it should be due to
the system's symmetry.


## 3D basins via recurrences

To showcase the true power of [`AttractorsViaRecurrences`](@ref) we need to use a system whose attractors span higher-dimensional space. An example is
```@example MAIN
ds = Systems.thomas_cyclical(b = 0.1665)
```
which, for this parameter, contains 5 coexisting attractors. 3 of them are entangled
periodic orbits that span across all three dimensions, and the remaining 2 are fixed points.

To compute the basins we define a three-dimensional grid and call on it
[`basins_of_attraction`](@ref).

```julia
# This computation takes about an hour
xg = yg = zg = range(-6.0, 6.0; length = 251)
mapper = AttractorsViaRecurrences(ds, (xg, yg, zg))
basins, attractors = basins_of_attraction(mapper)
attractors
```
```
Dict{Int16, StateSpaceSet{3, Float64}} with 5 entries:
  5 => 3-dimensional StateSpaceSet{Float64} with 1 points
  4 => 3-dimensional StateSpaceSet{Float64} with 379 points
  6 => 3-dimensional StateSpaceSet{Float64} with 1 points
  2 => 3-dimensional StateSpaceSet{Float64} with 538 points
  3 => 3-dimensional StateSpaceSet{Float64} with 537 points
  1 => 3-dimensional StateSpaceSet{Float64} with 1 points
```

The basins of attraction are very complicated. We can try to visualize them by animating the 2D slices at each z value, to obtain:

```@raw html
<video width="75%" height="auto" controls autoplay loop>
<source src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaDynamics/JuliaDynamics/master/videos/attractors/cyclical_basins.mp4?raw=true" type="video/mp4">
</video>
```

Then, we visualize the attractors to obtain:

```@raw html
<video width="75%" height="auto" controls autoplay loop>
<source src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaDynamics/JuliaDynamics/master/videos/attractors/cyclical_attractors.mp4?raw=true" type="video/mp4">
</video>
```

In the animation above, the scattered points are the attractor values the function [`AttractorsViaRecurrences`](@ref) found by itself. Of course, for the periodic orbits these points are incomplete. Once the function's logic understood we are on an attractor, it stops computing. However, we also simulated lines, by evolving initial conditions colored appropriately with the basins output.

The animation was produced with the code:
```julia
using GLMakie
fig = Figure()
display(fig)
ax = fig[1,1] = Axis3(fig; title = "found attractors")
cmap = cgrad(:dense, 6; categorical = true)

for i in keys(attractors)
    tr = attractors[i]
    markersize = length(attractors[i]) > 10 ? 2000 : 6000
    marker = length(attractors[i]) > 10 ? :circle : :rect
    scatter!(ax, columns(tr)...; markersize, marker, transparency = true, color = cmap[i])
    j = findfirst(isequal(i), bsn)
    x = xg[j[1]]
    y = yg[j[2]]
    z = zg[j[3]]
    tr = trajectory(ds, 100, SVector(x,y,z); Ttr = 100)
    lines!(ax, columns(tr)...; linewidth = 1.0, color = cmap[i])
end

a = range(0, 2π; length = 200) .+ π/4

record(fig, "cyclical_attractors.mp4", 1:length(a)) do i
    ax.azimuth = a[i]
end
```

## Basin fractions continuation in the magnetic pendulum

Perhaps the simplest application of [`continuation`](@ref) is to produce a plot of how the fractions of attractors change as we continuously change the parameter we changed above to calculate tipping probabilities.

### Computing the fractions

This is what the following code does:

```@example MAIN
# initialize projected magnetic pendulum
using Attractors, PredefinedDynamicalSystems
using Random: Xoshiro
ds = Systems.magnetic_pendulum(; d = 0.3, α = 0.2, ω = 0.5)
xg = yg = range(-3, 3; length = 101)
ds = ProjectedDynamicalSystem(ds, 1:2, [0.0, 0.0])
# Choose a mapper via recurrences
mapper = AttractorsViaRecurrences(ds, (xg, yg); Δt = 1.0)
# What parameter to change, over what range
γγ = range(1, 0; length = 101)
prange = [[1, 1, γ] for γ in γγ]
pidx = :γs
# important to make a sampler that respects the symmetry of the system
sampler, = statespace_sampler(Xoshiro(1234); spheredims = 2, radius = 3.0)
# continue attractors and basins:
# `Inf` threshold fits here, as attractors move smoothly in parameter space
rsc = RecurrencesFindAndMatch(mapper; threshold = Inf)
fractions_curves, attractors_info = continuation(
    rsc, prange, pidx, sampler;
    show_progress = false, samples_per_parameter = 100
)
# Show some characteristic fractions:
fractions_curves[[1, 50, 101]]
```


### Plotting the fractions
We visualize them using a predefined function that you can find in `docs/basins_plotting.jl`

```@example MAIN
# careful; `prange` isn't a vector of reals!
Main.basins_curves_plot(fractions_curves, γγ)
```


### "Bifurcation curves"

A by-product of the analysis is that we can obtain bifurcation curves for free. However, only the stable branches can be obtained!

```@example MAIN
fig = Figure()
ax = Axis(fig[1,1]; xlabel = L"\gamma_3", ylabel = "fixed point")
# choose how to go from attractor to real number representation
function real_number_repr(attractor)
    p = attractor[1]
    return (p[1] + p[2])/2
end

for (i, γ) in enumerate(γγ)
    for (k, attractor) in attractors_info[i]
        scatter!(ax, γ, real_number_repr(attractor); color = Cycled(k))
    end
end
fig
```

as you can see, two of the three fixed points, and their stability, do not depend at all on the parameter value, since this parameter value tunes the magnetic strength of only the third magnet. Nevertheless, the **fractions of basin of attraction** of all attractors depend strongly on the parameter. This is a simple example that highlights excellently how this new approach we propose here should be used even if one has already done a standard linearized bifurcation analysis.


## Extinction of a species in a multistable competition model

In this advanced example we utilize both [`RecurrencesFindAndMatch`](@ref) and [`aggregate_attractor_fractions`](@ref) in analyzing species extinction in a dynamical model of competition between multiple species.
The final goal is to show the percentage of how much of the state space leads to the extinction or not of a pre-determined species, as we vary a parameter. The model however displays extreme multistability, a feature we want to measure and preserve before aggregating information into "extinct or not".

To measure and preserve this we will apply [`RecurrencesFindAndMatch`](@ref) as-is first. Then we can aggregate information. First we have
```julia
using Attractors, OrdinaryDiffEq
using PredefinedDynamicalSystems
using Random: Xoshiro
# arguments to algorithms
samples_per_parameter = 1000
total_parameter_values = 101
diffeq = (alg = Vern9(), reltol = 1e-9, abstol = 1e-9, maxiters = Inf)
recurrences_kwargs = (; Δt= 1.0, mx_chk_fnd_att=9, diffeq);
# initialize dynamical syste and sampler
ds = PredefinedDynamicalSystems.multispecies_competition() # 8-dimensional
ds = CoupledODEs(ODEProblem(ds), diffeq)
# define grid in state space
xg = range(0, 60; length = 300)
grid = ntuple(x -> xg, 8)
prange = range(0.2, 0.3; length = total_parameter_values)
pidx = :D
sampler, = statespace_sampler(Xoshiro(1234);
    min_bounds = minimum.(grid), max_bounds = maximum.(grid)
)
# initialize mapper
mapper = AttractorsViaRecurrences(ds, grid; recurrences_kwargs...)
# perform continuation of attractors and their basins
continuation = RecurrencesFindAndMatch(mapper; threshold = Inf)
fractions_curves, attractors_info = continuation(
    continuation, prange, pidx, sampler;
    show_progress = true, samples_per_parameter
);
Main.basins_curves_plot(fractions_curves, prange; separatorwidth = 1)
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaDynamics/JuliaDynamics/master/videos/attractors/multispecies_competition_fractions.png)

_this example is not actually run when building the docs, because it takes about 60 minutes to complete depending on the computer; we load precomputed results instead_

As you can see, the system has extreme multistability with 64 unique attractors
(according to the default matching behavior in [`RecurrencesFindAndMatch`](@ref); a stricter matching with less than `Inf` threshold would generate more "distinct" attractors).
One could also isolate a specific parameter slice, and do the same as what we do in
the [Fractality of 2D basins of the (4D) magnetic pendulum](@ref) example, to prove that the basin boundaries are fractal, thereby indeed confirming the paper title "Fundamental Unpredictability".

Regardless, we now want to continue our analysis to provide a figure similar to the
above but only with two colors: fractions of attractors where a species is extinct or not. Here's how:

```julia
species = 3 # species we care about its existence

featurizer = (A) -> begin
    i = isextinct(A, species)
    return SVector(Int32(i))
end
isextinct(A, idx = unitidxs) = all(a -> a <= 1e-2, A[:, idx])

# `minneighbors = 1` is crucial for grouping single attractors
groupingconfig = GroupViaClustering(; min_neighbors=1, optimal_radius_method=0.5)

aggregated_fractions, aggregated_info = aggregate_attractor_fractions(
    fractions_curves, attractors_info, featurizer, groupingconfig
)

Main.basins_curves_plot(aggregated_fractions, prange;
    separatorwidth = 1, colors = ["green", "black"],
    labels = Dict(1 => "extinct", 2 => "alive"),
)
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaDynamics/JuliaDynamics/master/videos/attractors/multispecies_competition_fractions_aggr.png)

(in hindsight, the labels are reversed; attractor 1 is the alive one, but oh well)

## Trivial featurizing and grouping for basins fractions

This is a rather trivial example showcasing the usage of [`AttractorsViaFeaturizing`](@ref). Let us use once again the magnetic pendulum example. For it, we have a really good idea of what features will uniquely describe each attractor: the last points of a trajectory (which should be very close to the magnetic the trajectory converged to). To provide this information to the [`AttractorsviaFeaturizing`](@ref) we just create a julia function that returns this last point

```@example MAIN
using Attractors
using PredefinedDynamicalSystems

ds = Systems.magnetic_pendulum(d=0.2, α=0.2, ω=0.8, N=3)
psys = ProjectedDynamicalSystem(ds, [1, 2], [0.0, 0.0])

function featurizer(X, t)
    return X[end]
end

mapper = AttractorsViaFeaturizing(psys, featurizer; Ttr = 200, T = 1)

xg = yg = range(-4, 4; length = 101)

sampler, = statespace_sampler(; min_bounds = [-4,-4], max_bounds=[4,4])

fs = basins_fractions(mapper, sampler; show_progress = false)
```
As expected, the fractions are each about 1/3 due to the system symmetry.


## Featurizing and grouping across parameters (MCBB)
Here we showcase the example of the Monte Carlo Basin Bifurcation publication.
For this, we will use [`GroupAcrossParametersContinuation`](@ref) while also providing a `par_weight = 1` keyword.
However, we will not use a network of 2nd order Kuramoto oscillators (as done in the paper by Gelbrecht et al.) because it is too costly to run on CI.
Instead, we will use the Henon map and try to group attractors into period 1 (fixed point), period 3, and divergence to infinity. We will also use a pre-determined optimal radius for clustering, as we know a-priory the expected distances of features in feature space (due to the contrived form of the `featurizer` function below).

```@example MAIN
using Attractors, Random

b, a = -0.9, 1.4 # notice the non-default parameters
henon_rule(x, p, n) = SVector{2}(1.0 - p[1]*x[1]^2 + x[2], p[2]*x[1])
henon = DeterministicIteratedMap(henon_rule, zeros(2), [a,b])

function featurizer(a, t) # feature based on period!
    tol = 1e-5
    if abs(a[end-1,1] - a[end,1]) < tol
        # period 1
        return [1]
    elseif abs(a[end-3,1] - a[end,1]) < tol
        # period 3
        return [3]
    else
        return [100]
    end
end

henon
```


```@example MAIN
clusterspecs = GroupViaClustering(optimal_radius_method = 1.0)
mapper = AttractorsViaFeaturizing(
    henon, featurizer, clusterspecs;
    T = 6, threaded = true, Ttr = 500,
)

continuation = GroupAcrossParameter(mapper; par_weight = 1.0)

ps = range(0.6, 1.1; length = 11)
pidx = 1
sampler, = statespace_sampler(Random.MersenneTwister(1234);
    min_bounds = [-2,-2], max_bounds = [2,2]
)

fractions_curves, clusters_info = Attractors.continuation(
    continuation, ps, pidx, sampler;
    samples_per_parameter = 100, show_progress = false
)
fractions_curves
```

Looking at the information of the "attractions" (here the clusters of the grouping procedure) makes it clear which label corresponds to which kind of attractor (fixed point, period 3, or divergence to infinity):

```@example MAIN
clusters_info
```

## Using histograms and histogram distances as features

One of the aspects discussed in the original MCBB paper and implementation was the usage of histograms of the means of the variables of a dynamical system as the feature vector. This is useful in very high dimensional systems, such as oscillator networks, where the histogram of the means is significantly different in synchronized or unsychronized states.

This is possible to do with current interface without any modifications, by using two more packages: ComplexityMeasures.jl to compute histograms, and Distances.jl for the Kullback-Leibler divergence (or any other measure of distance in the space of probability distributions you fancy).

The only code we need to write to achieve this feature is a custom featurizer and providing an alternative distance to `GroupViaClustering`. The code would look like this:

```julia
using Distances: KLDivergence
using ComplexityMeasures: ValueHistogram, FixedRectangularBinning, probabilities

# you decide the binning for the histogram, but for a valid estimation of
# distances, all histograms must have exactly the same bins, and hence be
# computed with fixed ranges, i.e., using the `FixedRectangularBinning`
const binning = FixedRectangularBinning(range(-5, 5; length = 11))

function histogram_featurizer(A, t)
    ms = mean.(columns(A)) # vector of mean of each variable
    p = probabilities(ValueHistogram(binning), ms) # this is the histogram
    return vec(p) # because Distances.jl doesn't know `Probabilities`
end

gconfig = GroupViaClustering(;
    clust_distance_metric = KLDivergence(), # or any other PDF distance
)
```

You can then pass the `histogram_featurizer` and `gconfig` to an [`AttractorsViaFeaturizing`](@ref) and use the rest of the library as usual.
