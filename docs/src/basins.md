# Basins of Attraction
This page provides several functions related to the basins of attraction and their boundaries. It requires you to have first understood the [Finding Attractors](@ref) page.


## Basins of attraction
Calculating basins of attraction, or their state space fractions, can be done with the functions:
- [`basins_fractions`](@ref)
- [`basins_of_attraction`](@ref).

```@docs

```

## Convergence times

```@docs

```

## Final state sensitivity / fractal boundaries
Several functions are provided related with analyzing the fractality of the boundaries of the basins of attraction:

- [`basins_fractal_dimension`](@ref)
- [`basin_entropy`](@ref)
- [`basins_fractal_test`](@ref)
- [`uncertainty_exponent`](@ref)
- [`test_wada_merge`](@ref)

```@docs

basin_entropy
basins_fractal_test
uncertainty_exponent
test_wada_merge
```

## Edge tracking and edge states
The edge tracking algorithm allows to locate and construct so-called edge states (also referred to as *Melancholia states*) embedded in the basin boundary separating different basins of attraction. These could be saddle points, unstable periodic orbits or chaotic saddles. The general idea is that these sets can be found because they act as attractors when restricting to the basin boundary.

## Tipping points
This page discusses functionality related with tipping points in dynamical systems with known rule. If instead you are interested in identifying tipping points in measured timeseries, have a look at [TransitionIndicators.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/TransitionIndicators.jl).

```@docs

```

## Minimal Fatal Shock
The algorithm to find minimal perturbation for arbitrary initial condition `u0` which will kick the system into different from the current basin.
