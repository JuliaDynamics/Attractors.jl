# Basins of Attraction
This page provides several functions related to the basins of attraction and their boundaries. It requires you to have first understood the [Finding Attractors](@ref) page.


## Basins of attraction
Calculating basins of attraction, or their state space fractions, can be done with the functions:
- [`basins_fractions`](@ref)
- [`basins_of_attraction`](@ref).

## Final state sensitivity / fractal boundaries
Several functions are provided related with analyzing the fractality of the boundaries of the basins of attraction:

- [`basins_fractal_dimension`](@ref)
- [`basin_entropy`](@ref)
- [`basins_fractal_test`](@ref)
- [`uncertainty_exponent`](@ref)
