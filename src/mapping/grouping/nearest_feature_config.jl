"""
    GroupViaNearestFeature(templates; kwargs...)

Initialize a struct that contains instructions on how to group features in
[`AttractorsViaFeaturizing`](@ref). `GroupViaNearestFeature` accepts a `template`,
which is a vector of features. Then, generated features from initial conditions in
[`AttractorsViaFeaturizing`](@ref) are labelled according to the feature in
`templates` that is closest (the label is the index of the closest template).

`templates` can be a vector or dictionary mapping keys to templates. Internally
all templates are converted to `SVector` for performance. Hence, it is strongly recommended
that both `templates` and the output of the `featurizer` function in
[`AttractorsViaFeaturizing`](@ref) return `SVector` types.

## Keyword arguments
- `metric = Euclidean()`: metric to be used to quantify distances in the feature space.
- `max_distance = Inf`: Maximum allowed distance between a feature and its nearest
  template for it to be assigned to that template. By default, `Inf` guarantees that a
  feature is assigned to its nearest template regardless of the distance.
  Features that exceed `max_distance` to their nearest template get labelled `-1`.
