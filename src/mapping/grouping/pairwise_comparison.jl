    GroupViaPairwiseComparison(; distance_threshold::Real, kwargs...)

Initialize a struct that contains instructions on how to group features in
[`AttractorsViaFeaturizing`](@ref). `GroupViaPairwiseComparison` groups features and
identifies clusters by considering the pairwise distance between features. It can be used
as an alternative to the clustering method in `GroupViaClustering`, having the
advantage that it is simpler, typically faster and uses less memory. 

## Keyword arguments
    
* `distance_threshold`: a real number defining the maximum distance two features can be to
  be considered in the same cluster - above the threshold, features are different. This
  value simply needs to be large enough to differentiate clusters.
* `distance_metric = Euclidean()`: A metric to be used in the clustering. It can be any
  function `f(a, b)` that returns the distance between any type of data structure (usually
  vectors or matrices of reals). Needs to be consistent with the `featurizer` function. All
  metrics from Distances.jl can be used here.
* `rescale_features = true`: if true, rescale each dimension of the extracted features
  separately into the range `[0,1]`. This typically leads to more accurate clustering.

## Description
This algorithm assumes that the features are well-separated into distinct clouds, with the
maximum radius of the cloud controlled by `distance_threshold`. Since the systems are
deterministic, this is achievable with a good-enough `featurizer` function, by removing
transients, and running the trajectories for sufficiently long. It then considers that
features belong to the same attractor when their pairwise distance, computed using
`distance_metric`, is smaller than or equal to `distance_threshold`, and that they belong
to different attractors when the distance is bigger. Attractors correspond to each
grouping of similar features. In this way, the key parameter `distance_threshold` is
basically the amount of variation permissible in the features belonging to the same
attractor. If they are well-chosen, the value can be relatively small and does not need to
be fine tuned. 

The `distance_threshold` should achieve a balance: one one hand, it should be large enough
to account for variations in the features from the same attractor - if it's not large
enough, the algorithm will find duplicate attractors. On the other hand, it should be
small enough to not group together features from distinct attractors. This requires some
knowledge of how spread the features are. If it's too big, the algorithm will miss some
attractors, as it groups 2+ distinct attractors together. Therefore, as a rule of thumb,
one can repeat the procedure a few times, starting with a relatively large value and
reducing it until no more attractors are found and no duplicates appear.

The method uses relatively little memory, as it only stores vectors whose size is on order
of the number of attractors of the system.
