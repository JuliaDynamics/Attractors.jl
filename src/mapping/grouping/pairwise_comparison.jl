"""
    GroupViaPairwiseComparison(; optimal_radius_method::Real, kwargs...)

Initialize a struct that contains instructions on how to group features in
[`AttractorsViaFeaturizing`](@ref). `GroupViaPairwiseComparison` groups features and
identifies clusters by considering the pairwise distance (using `distance_metric`) between
features. 

## Keyword arguments
    
* `distance_threshold`: a real number defining the maximum distance two features can be to
  be considered in the same cluster - above the threshold, features are different. This
  value simply needs to be large enough to differentiate clusters.
* `distance_metric = Euclidean()`: A metric to be used in the clustering. It can be any
  function `f(a, b)` that returns the distance between any type of data structure (usually
  vectors or matrices of reals). Needs to be consistent with the `featurizer` function. All
  metrics from Distances.jl can be used here.
* `rescale_features = true`: if true, rescale each dimension of the extracted features
  separately into the range `[0,1]`. This typically leads to more accurate clustering.

## Description

This algorithm considers that features belong to the same attractor when their pairwise
distance, computed using `distance_metric` is smaller or equal than `distance_threshold`,
and belong to different attractors when the distance is bigger than the threshold.
Attractors correspond to each grouping of similar features.
