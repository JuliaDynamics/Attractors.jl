    match_statespacesets!(a₊::AbstractDict, a₋; distance = Centroid(), threshold = Inf)

Given dictionaries `a₊, a₋` mapping IDs to `StateSpaceSet` instances,
match the IDs in dictionary `a₊` so that its sets that are the closest to
those in dictionary `a₋` get assigned the same key as in `a₋`.
Typically the +,- mean after and before some change of parameter of a system.

Return the replacement map, a dictionary mapping old keys of `a₊` to
the new ones that they were mapped to. You can obtain this map, without modifying
the dictionaries, by calling the [`replacement_map`](@ref) function directly.

## Keyword arguments

- `distance = Centroid()`: given to [`setsofsets_distances`](@ref).
- `threshold = Inf`: attractors with distance larger than the `threshold` are guaranteed
  to not be mapped to each other.

## Description

When finding attractors and their fractions in Attractors.jl,
different attractors get assigned different IDs. However
which attractor gets which ID is somewhat arbitrary. Finding the attractors of the
same system for slightly different parameters could label "similar" attractors (at
the different parameters) with different IDs.
`match_statespacesets!` tries to "match" them by modifying the IDs,
i.e., the keys of the given dictionaries. Do note however that there is nothing
in this function that is limited to attractors in the formal mathematical sense.
Any dictionary with `StateSpaceSet` values is a valid input and these sets
may represent attractors, trajectories, group of features, or anything else.

The matching happens according to the output of the [`setsofsets_distances`](@ref)
function with the keyword `distance`. `distance` can be whatever that function accepts,
i.e., one of `Centroid, Hausdorff, StrictlyMinimumDistance` or any arbitrary user-
provided function that given two sets it returns a positive number (their distance).
State space sets are then matched according to this distance.
First, all possible pairs (old, new, distance) are sorted according to their distance.
The pair with smallest distance is matched. Sets in matched pairs are removed from the
matching pool to ensure a unique mapping. Then, the next pair with least
remaining distance is matched, and the process repeats until all pairs are exhausted.

Additionally, you can provide a `threshold` value. If the distance between two attractors
is larger than this `threshold`, then it is guaranteed that the attractors will get assigned
different key in the dictionary `a₊` (which is the next available integer).

This method matches IDs of attractors whose basins of attraction before and after `b₋,b₊`
have the most overlap (in pixels). This overlap is normalized in 0-1 (with 1 meaning
100% overlap of pixels). The `threshold` in this case is compared to the inverse

different IDs guaranteed).

# Continuation matching (which can be used after continuation)

"""
    match_continuation!(fractions_curves::Vector{<:Dict}, attractors_info::Vector{<:Dict}; kwargs...)

Loop over all entries in the given arguments (which are typically the direct outputs of
[`continuation`](@ref) with [`RecurrencesFindAndMatch`](@ref)), and match the
attractor IDs in both the attractors container and the basins fractions container.
This means that we loop over each entry of the vectors (skipping the first),
and in each entry we attempt to match the dictionary keys to the keys of the
previous dictionary using [`match_statespacesets`](@ref).

The keywords `distance, threshold` are propagated to [`match_statespacesets`](@ref).
However, there is a unique keyword for `match_continuation!`: `use_vanished::Bool`.
If `true`, then attractors that existed before but have vanished are kept in "memory"
when it comes to matching: the new attractors are compared to the latest istance
of all attractors that have ever existed, and get match to their closest ones
as per [`match_statespacesets!`](@ref).
If `false`, vanished attractors are ignored. Note that in this case new attractors
that cannot be matched to any previous attractors will get an appropriately
incremented ID. E.g., if we started with three attractors, and attractor 3 vanished,
and at some later parameter value we again have three attractors, the new third
attractor will _not_ have ID 3, but 4 (i.e., the next available ID).

By default `use_vanished = !isinf(threshold)` and since the default value for
`threshold` is `Inf`, `use_vanished` is `false`.

The last keyword is `retract_keys = true` which will "retract" keys (i.e., make the
integers smaller integers) so that all unique IDs
are the 1-incremented positive integers. E.g., if the IDs where 1, 6, 8, they will become
1, 2, 3. The special id -1 is unaffected by this.
