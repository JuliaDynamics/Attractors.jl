    continuation(abc::AttractorsBasinsContinuation, prange, pidx, ics; kwargs...)

Find and continue attractors (or feature-based representations of attractors)
and the fractions of their basins of attraction across a parameter range.
`continuation` is the central function of the framework for global stability analysis
illustrated in [Datseris2023](@cite).

The continuation type `abc` is a subtype of `AttractorsBasinsContinuation`
and contains an [`AttractorMapper`](@ref). The mapper contains information
on how to find the attractors and basins of a dynamical system. Additional
arguments and keyword arguments given when creating `abc` further tune the continuation
and how attractors are matched across different parameter values.

The basin fractions and the attractors (or some representation of them) are continued
across the parameter range `prange`, for the parameter of the system with index `pidx`
(any index valid in [`set_parameter!`](@ref) can be used).

`ics` is a 0-argument function generating initial conditions for
the dynamical system (as in [`basins_fractions`](@ref)).

Possible subtypes of `AttractorsBasinsContinuation` are:

- [`RecurrencesFindAndMatch`](@ref)
- [`FeaturizeGroupAcrossParameter`](@ref)

## Return

1. `fractions_curves::Vector{Dict{Int, Float64}}`. The fractions of basins of attraction.
   `fractions_curves[i]` is a dictionary mapping attractor IDs to their basin fraction
   at the `i`-th parameter.
2. `attractors_info::Vector{Dict{Int, <:Any}}`. Information about the attractors.
   `attractors_info[i]` is a dictionary mapping attractor ID to information about the
   attractor at the `i`-th parameter.
   The type of information stored depends on the chosen continuation type.

## Keyword arguments

- `show_progress = true`: display a progress bar of the computation.
- `samples_per_parameter = 100`: amount of initial conditions sampled at each parameter
  from `ics`.
