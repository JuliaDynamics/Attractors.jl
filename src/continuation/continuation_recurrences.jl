    RecurrencesFindAndMatch <: AttractorsBasinsContinuation
    RecurrencesFindAndMatch(mapper::AttractorsViaRecurrences; kwargs...)

A method for [`continuation`](@ref) as in [Datseris2023](@cite) that is based on the
recurrences-based algorithm for finding attractors ([`AttractorsViaRecurrences`](@ref))
and the "matching attractors" functionality offered by [`match_statespacesets!`](@ref).

You can use `RAFM` as an alias.

## Description

At the first parameter slice of the continuation process, attractors and their fractions
are found as described in the [`AttractorsViaRecurrences`](@ref) mapper using recurrences
in state space. At each subsequent parameter slice,
new attractors are found by seeding initial conditions from the previously found
attractors and then running these initial conditions through the recurrences algorithm
of the `mapper`. Seeding initial conditions close to previous attractors accelerates
the main bottleneck of [`AttractorsViaRecurrences`](@ref), which is finding the attractors.

After the attractors are found, their fractions are computed by sampling new random initial
(using the provided `sampler` in [`continuation`](@ref)) and mapping them to attractors
using the [`AttractorsViaRecurrences`](@ref) mapper.
I.e., exactly as in [`basins_fractions`](@ref).

Then, the newly found attractors (and their fractions) are "matched" to the previous ones.
I.e., their _IDs are changed_, according to the [`match_statespacesets!`](@ref) function.
Typically, the matching process matches attractor IDs that are closest in state space
distance, but more options are possible, see [`match_statespacesets!`](@ref).

This process continues until all parameter values are exhausted and for each parameter
value the attractors and their fractions are found.

Note that since in this continuation the finding-attractors and matching-attractors
steps are completely independent. This means, that if you don't like the initial
outcome of the matching process, you may call [`rematch!`](@ref) on the outcome.

## Keyword arguments

- `distance, threshold`: propagated to [`match_statespacesets!`](@ref).
- `info_extraction = identity`: A function that takes as an input an attractor (`StateSpaceSet`)
  and outputs whatever information should be stored. It is used to return the
  `attractors_info` in [`continuation`](@ref).
- `seeds_from_attractor`: A function that takes as an input an attractor and returns
  an iterator of initial conditions to be seeded from the attractor for the next
  parameter slice. By default, we sample only the first stored point on the attractor.
