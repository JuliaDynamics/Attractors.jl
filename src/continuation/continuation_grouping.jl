    FeaturizeGroupAcrossParameter(mapper::AttractorsViaFeaturizing; kwargs...)

A method for [`continuation`](@ref).
It uses the featurizing approach discussed in [`AttractorsViaFeaturizing`](@ref)
and hence requires an instance of that mapper as an input.
When used in [`continuation`](@ref), features are extracted
and then grouped across a parameter range. Said differently, all features
of all initial conditions across all parameter values are put into the same "pool"
and then grouped as dictated by the `group_config` of the mapper.
After the grouping is finished the feature label fractions are distributed
to each parameter value they came from.

## Keyword arguments
- `info_extraction::Function` a function that takes as an input a vector of feature-vectors
  (corresponding to a cluster) and returns a description of the cluster.
  By default, the centroid of the cluster is used.
- `par_weight = 0`: See below the section on MCBB.

## MCBB special version

If the chosen grouping method is [`GroupViaClustering`](@ref), the additional keyword
`par_weight::Real` can be used. If it is ≠ 0, the distance matrix between features
obtains an extra weight that is proportional to the distance `par_weight*|p[i] - p[j]|`
between the parameters used when extracting features.
The range of parameters is normalized to 0-1
such that the largest distance in the parameter space is 1. The normalization is done
because the feature space is also (by default) normalized to 0-1.

This version of the algorithm is the original "MCBB" continuation method described
in [Gelbrecht2020](@cite), besides the improvements of clustering accuracy and performance
done by the developer team of Attractors.jl.
