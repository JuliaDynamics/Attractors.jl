The initial search radius is much bigger, `δ = 1.` by default.

"""
    stagger_and_step!(x0, ds::DynamicalSystem , N::Int, isinside::function; kwargs...) -> trajectory

This function implements the stagger-and-step method 
[^Sweet2001] to approximate the invariant non-attracting set 
governing the chaotic transient dynamics of a system, namely 
the stable manifold of a chaotic saddle. 

Given the dynamical system `ds` and a initial guess `x0` in a 
region *with no attractors* defined by the membership function 
`isinside`, the algorithm provides `N` points close to the 
stable manifold that escape from the region after a least `Tm` 
steps of `ds`. The search is stochastic and depends on the 
parameter `δ` defining a (small) neighborhood of search. 

The function `isinside(x)` returns `true` if the point `x` is 
inside the chosen bounded region and `false` otherwise. See 
[`statespace_sampler`](@ref) to construct this function.

## Description 

The method relies on the stagger-and-step algorithm that 
computes points close to the saddle that escapes in a time 
`T(x_n) > Tm`. The function `T` represents the escape time 
from a region defined by the user (see the argument 
`isinside`).

Given the dynamical mapping `F`, if the iteration `x_{n+1} = 
F(x_n)` respects the condition `T(x_{n+1}) > Tm` we accept 
this next point, this is the _step_ part of the method. If 
not, the method search randomly the next point in a 
neighborhood following a given probability distribution, this 
is the _stagger_ part. This part sometimes fails to find a new 
candidate and a new starting point of the trajectory is chosen 
within the defined region. See the keyword argument 
`stagger_mode` for the different available methods.   

The method produces a pseudo-trajectory of `N` points δ-close
to the stable manifold of the chaotic saddle. 

## Keyword arguments
* `δ = 1e-10`: it is a small number constraining the random
  search around a particular point. The interpretation of this 
  number will depend on the distribution chosen for the 
  generation (see `stagger_mode`).

* `Tm = 30`: The minimum number of iterations of `ds` before 
  the trajectory escapes from the bounding box defined by
  `isinside`. 

* `max_steps = 10^5`: The search for a new candidate point may 
  fail at some point. If the search fails after `max_steps`, 
  a new initial point is set and the method starts from a new
  point 

* `stagger_mode = :exp`: There are several ways to produce 
  candidate points `x` that have to fulfill the condition 
  `T(x) > Tm`. The available methods are: 

    * `:exp`: An candidate following an truncated exponential 
      distribution in a random direction `u` around the current
      `x` such that `x_c = x + u*r`. `r = 10^-s` with `s` taken
      from a uniform distribution in [-15, δ]. This mode fails
      often but stills manage to provide long enough stretch of
      trajectories. 

    * `:unif`: The next candidate is `x_c = x + u*r` with `r` 
      taken from a uniform distribution [0,δ]. 
    * `:adaptive`: The next candidate is `x_c = x + u*r` with 
      `r` drawn from a gaussian distribution with variance  δ.
      The variance changes according to a free parameter `f`  
      such that `δ = δ/f` if no candidate is found and `δ = δ*f`
      when it succeeds.    
* `f = 1.1`: It is the free parameter for the adaptive stagger
  method.
