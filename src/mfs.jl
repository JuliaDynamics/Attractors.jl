    minimal_fatal_shock(mapper::AttractorMapper, u0, search_area, algorithm) â†’ mfs

Return the minimal fatal shock `mfs` for the initial point `u0` according to the
specified `algorithm` given a `mapper` that satisfies the `id = mapper(u0)` interface
(see [`AttractorMapper`](@ref) if you are not sure which mappers do that).
The `mapper` contains a reference to a [`DynamicalSystem`](@ref).
The options for `algorithm` are: [`MFSBruteForce`](@ref) or [`MFSBlackBoxOptim`](@ref).

The `search_area` dictactes the state space range for the search of the `mfs`.
It can be a 2-tuple of (min, max) values, in which case the same values are used
for each dimension of the system in `mapper`. Otherwise, it can be a vector of 2-tuples,
each for each dimension of the system.

## Description

The minimal fatal shock algorithm is defined as the smallest perturbation of the initial
point `u0` that will lead it a different basin of attraction. It is inspired by the paper
"Minimal fatal shocks in multistable complex networks" [Halekotte2020](@cite),
however the implementation here is generic: it works for _any_ dynamical system.

While working with high dimensional systems, we recommend using [`MFSBlackBoxOptim`](@ref)
algorithm, as it will give more precise results. While you can use [`MFSBruteForce`](@ref)
algorithm to quickly obtain some guess which you can pass as the argument in initialization
of [`MFSBlackBoxOptim`](@ref) algorithm to optimize it and obtain exact results more
efficiently. Or you can also pass [`MFSBruteForce`](@ref) algorithm as the argument in
initialization of [`MFSBlackBoxOptim`](@ref) with parameter `random_algo`. We recommend to pay
attention to setup parameters of the algorithms, as default settings may not be sufficient
to obtain precise results in some cases. Parameters `MaxSteps` and `search_area` are crucial
in initialization of [`MFSBlackBoxOptim`](@ref) algorithm. The higher the `MaxSteps` value,
the more precise results may be obtained with the cost of longer computation time.
By manually decresing approximaton of `search_area`, you may significantly optimize
algorithm's performance.

"""
    MFSBruteForce(; kwargs...)

Initialize the randomised algorithm used in `minimal_fatal_shock` function. It consists of
two steps: random initialization and sphere radius reduction. On the first step,
the algorithm generates random pertubations of the initial point `u0` and with the best
obtained pertubation it proceeds to the second step. On the second step, the algorithm
generates random pertubations  on the surface of the hypersphere with radius equal to the
norm of the best pertubation found in the first step. It reduces the radius
of the hypersphere to continue searching for the better result within smaller radius.

## Keyword arguments

- `initial_iterations` number of random pertubations to try in the first step of the
  algorithm, default = 10000.
- `sphere_iterations` number of steps while initializing random points on hypersphere and
  decreasing its radius, default = 10000.
- `sphere_decrease_step` factor by which the radius of the hypersphere is decreased,
  default = 1000.0, the higher the value, the more precise values may be obtained.

Initialize the optimization algorithm used in `minimal_fatal_shock` function. It uses
BlackBoxOptim.jl package to find the best shock. It is based on derivative free
optimization and uses the objective function with penalties to find the minimal fatal shock.

## Keyword arguments
- `guess` vector of initial guesses for the optimization algorithm, `default = []`.
- `MaxSteps` maximum number of steps for the optimization algorithm, default = 10000.
- `penalty` penalty value for the objective function, allows to adjust optimization algorithm
  to find the minimal fatal shock, `default = 1000.0`
- `PrintInfo` boolean value, if true, the optimization algorithm will print information on
  the evaluation steps of objective function, `default = false`.
- `random_algo` algorithm used to find the initial guess for the optimization algorithm,
  by default it is initialized as `MFSBruteForce(0,0,0)` and not used. To activate it,
  you need to initialize it with the parameters you want to use,
  e.g. `MFSBruteForce(1000,1000,100.0)` or `MFSBruteForce()` with default parameters.

This function generates a random pertubation of the initial point `u0` within
specified "search_area" and checks if it is in the same basin of attraction.
It does so by generating a random vector of length dim and then adding it to u0.
If the pertubation is not in the same basin of attraction, it calculates the norm
of the pertubation and compares it to the best pertubation found so far.
If the norm is smaller, it updates the best pertubation found so far.
It repeats this process total_iterations times and returns the best pertubation found.
