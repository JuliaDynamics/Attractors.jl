    minimal_fatal_shock(mapper::AttractorMapper, u0, search_area, algorithm) → mfs

Return the minimal fatal shock `mfs` for the initial point `u0` according to the
specified `algorithm` given a `mapper` that satisfies the `id = mapper(u0)` interface
(see [`AttractorMapper`](@ref) if you are not sure which mappers do that).
The `mapper` contains a reference to a [`DynamicalSystem`](@ref).
The options for `algorithm` are: [`MFSBruteForce`](@ref) or [`MFSBlackBoxOptim`](@ref).
Forh high dimensional systems [`MFSBlackBoxOptim`](@ref) is likely more accurate.

The `search_area` dictates the state space range for the search of the `mfs`.
It can be a 2-tuple of (min, max) values, in which case the same values are used
for each dimension of the system in `mapper`. Otherwise, it can be a vector of 2-tuples,
each for each dimension of the system. The search area is defined w.r.t. to `u0`
(i.e., it is the search area for perturbations of `u0`).

## Description

The minimal fatal shock is defined as the smallest (smallest norm) perturbation of the initial
point `u0` that will lead it a different basin of attraction. It is inspired by the paper
"Minimal fatal shocks in multistable complex networks" [Halekotte2020](@cite),
however the implementation here is generic: it works for _any_ dynamical system.

"""
    MFSBruteForce(; kwargs...)

The brute force randomized search algorithm used in [`minimal_fatal_shock`](@ref).

It consists of
two steps: random initialization and sphere radius reduction. On the first step,
the algorithm generates random pertubations within the search area and records
the perturbation that leads to a different basin but with the smallest magnitude.
With this
obtained pertubation it proceeds to the second step. On the second step, the algorithm
generates random pertubations on the surface of the hypersphere with radius equal to the
norm of the pertubation found in the first step.
It reduces the radius of the hypersphere and continues searching for the better result
with a smaller radius. Each time a better result is found, the radius is reduced further.

The algorithm records the perturbation with smallest radius that leads to a different basin.

## Keyword arguments

- `initial_iterations = 10000`: number of random pertubations to try in the first step of the
  algorithm.
- `sphere_iterations = 10000`: number of steps while initializing random points on hypersphere and
  decreasing its radius.
- `sphere_decrease_factor = 0.999` factor by which the radius of the hypersphere is decreased
  (at each step the radius is multiplied by this number). Number closer to 1 means
  more refined accuracy

This function generates a random pertubation of the initial point `u0` within

of the pertubation and compares it to the best pertubation found so far.
If the norm is smaller, it updates the best pertubation found so far.

"""
    MFSBlackBoxOptim(; kwargs...)

The black box derivative-free optimization algorithm used in [`minimal_fatal_shock`](@ref).

## Keyword arguments

- `guess = nothing` a initial guess for the minimal fatal shock given to the
  optimization algorithm. If not `nothing`, `random_algo` below is ignored.
- `max_steps = 10000` maximum number of steps for the optimization algorithm.
- `penalty` penalty value for the objective function, allows to adjust optimization algorithm
  to find the minimal fatal shock, `default = 1000.0`
- `print_info` boolean value, if true, the optimization algorithm will print information on
  the evaluation steps of objective function, `default = false`.
- `random_algo = MFSBruteForce(100, 100, 0.99)`: an instance of [`MFSBruteForce`](@ref)
  that can be used to provide an initial guess.

## Description

The algorithm uses BlackBoxOptim.jl and a penaltized objective function to minimize.
y function used as a constraint function.
So, if we hit another basin during the search we encourage the algorithm otherwise we
punish it with some penalty. The function to minimize is (besides some details):
```julia
function mfs_objective(perturbation, u0, mapper, penalty)
    dist = norm(perturbation)
    if mapper(u0 + perturbation) == mapper(u0)
        # penaltize if we stay in the same basin:
        return dist + penalty
    else
        return dist
    end
end
```
Using an initial guess can be beneficial to both performance and accuracy,
which is why the output of a crude [`MFSBruteForce`](@ref) is used to provide a guess.
This can be disabled by either passing a `guess` vector explicitly or
by giving `nothing` as `random_algo`.
